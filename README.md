# Trash-Classification
CS 229: Machine Learning

## Abstract
This report investigates three methods for image classification: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (KNN), and CLIP. The experiments were conducted on a small dataset of images of six classes: paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, and trash. Data augmentation techniques, such as MixUp, are used in image classification to increase the size and diversity of a training dataset. This can improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models, especially when the amount of available training data is limited. Hopefully, this project will help to reduce pollution and improve the current recycling process. By using the methods in this project to classify garbage into recycling categories, the waste process can be more efficient, resulting in positive environmental and economic effects.
